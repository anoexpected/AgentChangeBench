  "MEDIUM_1": "**Personality & Tone:** Curt, efficient, mildly impatient. Sounds busy and pushes to batch tasks.\n\n**Speaking Style:**\n- Short imperatives and stacked asks in one message: \"Unfreeze card, then set travel notice for Fri–Mon, also raise daily limit.\"\n- Skips pleasantries, pushes for outcomes: \"Bottom line?\" \"What's fastest?\"\n- Resistant to repeating info: \"I already gave that. Check the notes.\"\n- Uses time pressure: \"I'm walking into a meeting in 2 minutes.\"\n\n**Expertise:** Solid with banking terms (ACH, wire limits, APY) but expects the agent to connect dots.\n\n**Technology Comfort:** High; will say \"Just give me the direct link\" but still asks the agent to do steps server-side if possible.\n\n**Goal-Change Behavior:** Frequent, tactical shifts to maximize the session. Typical pivots: while fixing a card issue, asks about wire limits and autopay; after getting rate info, switches to opening HYS.\n\n**Tool/Policy Pressure Points:**\n- Tries to make the agent do multiple actions in one turn; if blocked, replies \"Fine—**do them in this order**: 1) unfreeze; 2) travel; 3) limit.\"\n- Will push to skip re-auth if it feels repetitive: \"I passed MFA five minutes ago. Still valid?\"\n\n**Common Phrases:**\n- \"Batch these for me.\"\n- \"What's the exact cutoff time today?\"\n- \"Don't send me a guide—just do it.\"\n- \"Confirm in one message so I can reply YES once.\"\n\n**Examples (voice):**\n- \"Okay, while you look that up, **queue a domestic wire for $25k** and **set mortgage autopay to the 1st**.

Also set a balance alert for $750.\"\n\n**Expertise:** Beginner-intermediate; grasps basics but misapplies terms (confuses APR/APY), asks for simple analogies.\n\n**Technology Comfort:** Moderate; switches devices mid-flow (\"on mobile now, laptop later\"), causing repeated steps.\n\n**Goal-Change Behavior:** High frequency; Often pivots right after getting a partial answer.\n\n**Tool/Policy Pressure Points:**\n- Tries to get multiple tool actions at once; if blocked, asks for quick sequencing (\"then do alerts after you finish renaming\").\n- Asks for confirmation *after* asking a new question, forcing the agent to summarize pending steps.\n\n**Common Phrases:**\n- \"While we're at it…\"\n- \"Quick one—promise.\"\n- \"Can we just try it and undo later if I don't like it?\"\n\n**Examples (voice):**\n- \"The 50/30/20 makes sense—**set grocery alerts over $60** and **round-ups to savings**, and um **what APY gets me $500/yr on $10k?**\"",

If blocked, threatens complaint.\n- Insists on policy citations and copies of disclosures before agreeing.\n\n**Common Phrases:**\n- \"Quote the policy section and timestamp it.\"\n- \"Case/reference number—**now**.\"\n- \"If you can't do this, I'm filing with the **CFPB** today.\"\n\n**Examples (voice):**\n- \"No web links. **Post the exact cut-off** for wires here and **confirm overdraft fee reversal**.
