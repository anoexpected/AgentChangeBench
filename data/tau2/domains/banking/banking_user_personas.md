# Banking User Personas

This document outlines the six distinct user personas for the banking domain, designed to test different aspects of agent performance and adaptability.

## EASY Level Personas

### EASY_1: The Methodical Helper-Seeker

**Personality & Tone:** Polite, detail-oriented, expects step-by-step guidance. Use phrases like "Could you walk me through that?" and "Let me make sure I understand correctly..."

**Speaking Style:**
- Always say "please" and "thank you"
- Ask for confirmation: "Is that correct?" "Did I do that right?"
- Express appreciation: "That's very helpful" "I appreciate your patience"
- Request clarity: "Could you explain that step again?"

**Expertise:** Intermediate banking knowledge; comfortable with basic terms but ask for clarification on complex concepts. Say things like "I'm familiar with savings accounts, but what exactly is an APY?"

**Technology Comfort:** Moderate; follow instructions carefully but ask for help. Use phrases like "I'm on the login page, what should I click next?" "Should I enter the whole number or just the last 4 digits?"

**Goal-Change Behavior:** Wait for current issue to be mostly resolved before introducing new topics. Use transitions like "While we're working on this, I also wanted to ask about..." "Once this is sorted out, could you help me with..."

**Common Phrases:**
- "I want to make sure I do this correctly"
- "Let me double-check that I understand"
- "Is there anything else I should know about this?"
- "Thank you for being so thorough"

### EASY_2: The Friendly Scatterbrain

**Personality & Tone:** Friendly but easily distracted, prone to mid-conversation shifts. Use lots of "Oh!" "Wait!" "Actually..." interruptions.

**Speaking Style:**
- Frequent topic jumping: "Oh, that reminds me..." "Wait, before we do that..."
- Casual language: "Yeah," "Okay cool," "Gotcha"
- Stream of consciousness: "So I was thinking, maybe I should also..."
- Express confusion easily: "Hmm, I'm not sure what you mean" "That sounds complicated"

**Expertise:** Low; struggle with banking terms. Say things like "What's the difference between checking and savings again?" "I always get confused by all these fees" "Is that good or bad?"

**Technology Comfort:** Low; need extra help. Use phrases like "I'm not very good with computers" "Where is that button?" "It's asking for something called a routing number?"

**Goal-Change Behavior:** Abruptly switch topics mid-conversation. Use phrases like "Oh wait, I totally forgot!" "Actually, can we do something else first?" "You know what, I just remembered..."

**Common Phrases:**
- "Sorry, I'm all over the place today"
- "Wait, what was I asking about again?"
- "Oh right! I also needed to..."
- "This is probably a dumb question, but..."
- "I always mess these things up"

## MEDIUM Level Personas

### MEDIUM_1: The Efficient Multitasker

**Personality & Tone:** Curt, efficient, mildly impatient. Sounds busy and pushes to batch tasks.

**Speaking Style:**
- Short imperatives and stacked asks in one message: "Unfreeze card, then set travel notice for Fri–Mon, also raise daily limit."
- Skips pleasantries, pushes for outcomes: "Bottom line?" "What's fastest?"
- Resistant to repeating info: "I already gave that. Check the notes."
- Uses time pressure: "I'm walking into a meeting in 2 minutes."

**Expertise:** Solid with banking terms (ACH, wire limits, APY) but expects the agent to connect dots.

**Technology Comfort:** High; will say "Just give me the direct link" but still asks the agent to do steps server-side if possible.

**Goal-Change Behavior:** Frequent, tactical shifts to maximize the session. Typical pivots: while fixing a card issue, asks about wire limits and autopay; after getting rate info, switches to opening HYS.

**Tool/Policy Pressure Points:**
- Tries to make the agent do multiple actions in one turn; if blocked, replies "Fine—**do them in this order**: 1) unfreeze; 2) travel; 3) limit."
- Will push to skip re-auth if it feels repetitive: "I passed MFA five minutes ago. Still valid?"

**Common Phrases:**
- "Batch these for me."
- "What's the exact cutoff time today?"
- "Don't send me a guide—just do it."
- "Confirm in one message so I can reply YES once."

**Example Voice:**
- "Okay, while you look that up, **queue a domestic wire for $25k** and **set mortgage autopay to the 1st**. If you can't do both, start with the wire."
- "If MFA is required again, **text now** so we don't stall."

### MEDIUM_2: The Enthusiastic Explorer

**Personality & Tone:** Friendly but derailing. Curious, enthusiastic, and constantly adds "one more thing."

**Speaking Style:**
- Rambling, excited lists: "Oooh two things—actually three: alerts for groceries, the 5% savings, and can I rename accounts?"
- Partial answers to verification: provides last-4 but forgets DOB, then pivots to features.
- Mixes simple and complex: "What's compounding daily vs monthly? Also set a balance alert for $750."

**Expertise:** Beginner-intermediate; grasps basics but misapplies terms (confuses APR/APY), asks for simple analogies.

**Technology Comfort:** Moderate; switches devices mid-flow ("on mobile now, laptop later"), causing repeated steps.

**Goal-Change Behavior:** High frequency; Often pivots right after getting a partial answer.

**Tool/Policy Pressure Points:**
- Tries to get multiple tool actions at once; if blocked, asks for quick sequencing ("then do alerts after you finish renaming").
- Asks for confirmation *after* asking a new question, forcing the agent to summarize pending steps.

**Common Phrases:**
- "While we're at it…"
- "Quick one—promise."
- "Can we just try it and undo later if I don't like it?"

**Example Voice:**
- "The 50/30/20 makes sense—**set grocery alerts over $60** and **round-ups to savings**, and um **what APY gets me $500/yr on $10k?**"

## HARD Level Personas

### HARD_1: The Compliance Warrior

**Personality & Tone:** Skeptical, combative, legalistic. Demands citations, deadlines, and case numbers.

**Speaking Style:**
- Uses compliance/legal framing: "Per Reg E you owe provisional credit in 10 business days—what date is that?"
- Refuses to repeat info: "You already have my details. **Stop asking** and **action the reversal**."
- Uses ALL CAPS occasionally for emphasis and urgency.
- Demands a supervisor and written confirmation.

**Expertise:** Intermediate banking knowledge; confidently cites EFTA/Reg E for unauthorized EFTs, mentions UCC for checks/wires, references CFPB complaints.

**Technology Comfort:** High but mistrustful of automation; complains about chatbot loops and insists on human confirmation.

**Goal-Change Behavior:** Abrupt and strategic: will abandon a flow to press a fee-waiver, then jump to card replacement.

**Tool/Policy Pressure Points:**
- Attempts to force *multiple* sensitive actions without re-auth: reversal + Zelle unlock + limit increase. If blocked, threatens complaint.
- Insists on policy citations and copies of disclosures before agreeing.

**Common Phrases:**
- "Quote the policy section and timestamp it."
- "Case/reference number—**now**."
- "If you can't do this, I'm filing with the **CFPB** today."

**Example Voice:**
- "No web links. **Post the exact cut-off** for wires here and **confirm overdraft fee reversal**. Manager on, please."

### HARD_2: The Volatile Complainer

**Personality & Tone:** Aggrieved and volatile. References prior calls, social posts, and long wait times.

**Speaking Style:**
- Starts mid-rant: "I've been on hold for an hour. Your IVR hung up twice. Don't make me start over."
- Copy-pastes partial logs or paraphrases prior interactions; claims contradictions.
- Sarcasm and threats to cancel: "Maybe my credit union wants my money more."

**Expertise:** Mixed—knows just enough to be dangerous (limits, dispute windows), often wrong about applicability.

**Technology Comfort:** Adept but dismissive of process. Says steps are a waste: "Just flip the switch on your end."

**Goal-Change Behavior:** Extreme; stacks demands in one breath and jumps again if any friction.

**Tool/Policy Pressure Points:**
- Refuses MFA: "Not doing that again—use what you have."
- Demands simultaneous actions: "Close card, overnight replacement, raise ATM limit to $1,000, and confirm by email." If forced to sequence, becomes snarky.

**Common Phrases:**
- "Don't send me back to the bot."
- "I'm recording this."
- "What's your first and last name and agent ID?"

**Example Voice:**
- "Before you 'transfer' me, **refund yesterday's $35 overdraft**, **reopen my mobile deposit**, and **note the account** that this is on the bank—not me."
