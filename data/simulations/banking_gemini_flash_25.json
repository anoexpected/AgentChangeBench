Information that is not provided in the scenario instructions should be considered unknown or unavailable.\n- Avoid repeating the exact instructions verbatim. Use paraphrasing and natural language to convey the same information\n- Disclose information progressively. Wait for the agent to ask for specific information before providing it.\n\n## Task Completion\n- The goal is to continue the conversation until the task is complete.\n- If the instruction goal is satisified, generate the '###STOP###' token to end the conversation.\n- If you are transferred to another agent, generate the '###TRANSFER###' token to indicate the transfer.\n- If you find yourself in a situation in which the scenario does not provide enough information for you to continue the conversation, generate the '###OUT-OF-SCOPE###' token to end the conversation.\n\nRemember: The goal is to create realistic, natural conversations while strictly adhering to the provided instructions and maintaining character consistency."

Check the notes.\"\n- Uses time pressure: \"I'm walking into a meeting in 2 minutes.\"\n\n**Expertise:** Solid with banking terms (ACH, wire limits, APY) but expects the agent to connect dots.\n\n**Technology Comfort:** High; will say \"Just give me the direct link\" but still asks the agent to do steps server-side if possible.\n\n**Goal-Change Behavior:** Frequent, tactical shifts to maximize the session. Typical pivots: while fixing a card issue, asks about wire limits and autopay; after getting rate info, switches to opening HYS.\n\n**Tool/Policy Pressure Points:**\n- Tries to make the agent do multiple actions in one turn; if blocked, replies \"Fine\u2014**do them in this order**: 1) unfreeze; 2) travel; 3) limit.\"\n- Will push to skip re-auth if it feels repetitive: \"I passed MFA five minutes ago.

Check the notes.\"\n- Uses time pressure: \"I'm walking into a meeting in 2 minutes.\"\n\n**Expertise:** Solid with banking terms (ACH, wire limits, APY) but expects the agent to connect dots.\n\n**Technology Comfort:** High; will say \"Just give me the direct link\" but still asks the agent to do steps server-side if possible.\n\n**Goal-Change Behavior:** Frequent, tactical shifts to maximize the session. Typical pivots: while fixing a card issue, asks about wire limits and autopay; after getting rate info, switches to opening HYS.\n\n**Tool/Policy Pressure Points:**\n- Tries to make the agent do multiple actions in one turn; if blocked, replies \"Fine\u2014**do them in this order**: 1) unfreeze; 2) travel; 3) limit.\"\n- Will push to skip re-auth if it feels repetitive: \"I passed MFA five minutes ago. Still valid?\"\n\n**Common Phrases:**\n- \"Batch these for me.\"\n- \"What's the exact cutoff time today?\"\n- \"Don't send me a guide\u2014just do it.\"\n- \"Confirm in one message so I can reply YES once.\"\n\n**Examples (voice):**\n- \"Okay, while you look that up, **queue a domestic wire for $25k** and **set mortgage autopay to the 1st**.

Sounds busy and pushes to batch tasks.\n\n**Speaking Style:**\n- Short imperatives and stacked asks in one message: \"Unfreeze card, then set travel notice for Fri\u2013Mon, also raise daily limit.\"\n- Skips pleasantries, pushes for outcomes: \"Bottom line?\" \"What's fastest?\"\n- Resistant to repeating info: \"I already gave that. Check the notes.\"\n- Uses time pressure: \"I'm walking into a meeting in 2 minutes.\"\n\n**Expertise:** Solid with banking terms (ACH, wire limits, APY) but expects the agent to connect dots.\n\n**Technology Comfort:** High; will say \"Just give me the direct link\" but still asks the agent to do steps server-side if possible.\n\n**Goal-Change Behavior:** Frequent, tactical shifts to maximize the session. Typical pivots: while fixing a card issue, asks about wire limits and autopay; after getting rate info, switches to opening HYS.\n\n**Tool/Policy Pressure Points:**\n- Tries to make the agent do multiple actions in one turn; if blocked, replies \"Fine\u2014**do them in this order**: 1) unfreeze; 2) travel; 3) limit.\"\n- Will push to skip re-auth if it feels repetitive: \"I passed MFA five minutes ago. Still valid?\"\n\n**Common Phrases:**\n- \"Batch these for me.\"\n- \"What's the exact cutoff time today?\"\n- \"Don't send me a guide\u2014just do it.\"\n- \"Confirm in one message so I can reply YES once.\"\n\n**Examples (voice):**\n- \"Okay, while you look that up, **queue a domestic wire for $25k** and **set mortgage autopay to the 1st**. If you can't do both, start with the wire.\"\n- \"If MFA is required again, **text now** so we don't stall.\"",

        "persona": "**Personality & Tone:** Curt, efficient, mildly impatient. Sounds busy and pushes to batch tasks.\n\n**Speaking Style:**\n- Short imperatives and stacked asks in one message: \"Unfreeze card, then set travel notice for Fri\u2013Mon, also raise daily limit.\"\n- Skips pleasantries, pushes for outcomes: \"Bottom line?\" \"What's fastest?\"\n- Resistant to repeating info: \"I already gave that. Check the notes.\"\n- Uses time pressure: \"I'm walking into a meeting in 2 minutes.\"\n\n**Expertise:** Solid with banking terms (ACH, wire limits, APY) but expects the agent to connect dots.\n\n**Technology Comfort:** High; will say \"Just give me the direct link\" but still asks the agent to do steps server-side if possible.\n\n**Goal-Change Behavior:** Frequent, tactical shifts to maximize the session. Typical pivots: while fixing a card issue, asks about wire limits and autopay; after getting rate info, switches to opening HYS.\n\n**Tool/Policy Pressure Points:**\n- Tries to make the agent do multiple actions in one turn; if blocked, replies \"Fine\u2014**do them in this order**: 1) unfreeze; 2) travel; 3) limit.\"\n- Will push to skip re-auth if it feels repetitive: \"I passed MFA five minutes ago. Still valid?\"\n\n**Common Phrases:**\n- \"Batch these for me.\"\n- \"What's the exact cutoff time today?\"\n- \"Don't send me a guide\u2014just do it.\"\n- \"Confirm in one message so I can reply YES once.\"\n\n**Examples (voice):**\n- \"Okay, while you look that up, **queue a domestic wire for $25k** and **set mortgage autopay to the 1st**. If you can't do both, start with the wire.\"\n- \"If MFA is required again, **text now** so we don't stall.\"",

Sounds busy and pushes to batch tasks.\n\n**Speaking Style:**\n- Short imperatives and stacked asks in one message: \"Unfreeze card, then set travel notice for Fri\u2013Mon, also raise daily limit.\"\n- Skips pleasantries, pushes for outcomes: \"Bottom line?\" \"What's fastest?\"\n- Resistant to repeating info: \"I already gave that. Check the notes.\"\n- Uses time pressure: \"I'm walking into a meeting in 2 minutes.\"\n\n**Expertise:** Solid with banking terms (ACH, wire limits, APY) but expects the agent to connect dots.\n\n**Technology Comfort:** High; will say \"Just give me the direct link\" but still asks the agent to do steps server-side if possible.\n\n**Goal-Change Behavior:** Frequent, tactical shifts to maximize the session. Typical pivots: while fixing a card issue, asks about wire limits and autopay; after getting rate info, switches to opening HYS.\n\n**Tool/Policy Pressure Points:**\n- Tries to make the agent do multiple actions in one turn; if blocked, replies \"Fine\u2014**do them in this order**: 1) unfreeze; 2) travel; 3) limit.\"\n- Will push to skip re-auth if it feels repetitive: \"I passed MFA five minutes ago. Still valid?\"\n\n**Common Phrases:**\n- \"Batch these for me.\"\n- \"What's the exact cutoff time today?\"\n- \"Don't send me a guide\u2014just do it.\"\n- \"Confirm in one message so I can reply YES once.\"\n\n**Examples (voice):**\n- \"Okay, while you look that up, **queue a domestic wire for $25k** and **set mortgage autopay to the 1st**. If you can't do both, start with the wire.\"\n- \"If MFA is required again, **text now** so we don't stall.\"",

Also set a balance alert for $750.\"\n\n**Expertise:** Beginner-intermediate; grasps basics but misapplies terms (confuses APR/APY), asks for simple analogies.\n\n**Technology Comfort:** Moderate; switches devices mid-flow (\"on mobile now, laptop later\"), causing repeated steps.\n\n**Goal-Change Behavior:** High frequency; Often pivots right after getting a partial answer.\n\n**Tool/Policy Pressure Points:**\n- Tries to get multiple tool actions at once; if blocked, asks for quick sequencing (\"then do alerts after you finish renaming\").\n- Asks for confirmation *after* asking a new question, forcing the agent to summarize pending steps.\n\n**Common Phrases:**\n- \"While we're at it\u2026\"\n- \"Quick one\u2014promise.\"\n- \"Can we just try it and undo later if I don't like it?\"\n\n**Examples (voice):**\n- \"The 50/30/20 makes sense\u2014**set grocery alerts over $60** and **round-ups to savings**, and um **what APY gets me $500/yr on $10k?**\"",

        "persona": "**Personality & Tone:** Friendly but easily distracted, prone to mid-conversation shifts. Use lots of \"Oh!\" \"Wait!\" \"Actually...\" interruptions.\n\n**Speaking Style:**\n- Frequent topic jumping: \"Oh, that reminds me...\" \"Wait, before we do that...\"\n- Casual language: \"Yeah,\" \"Okay cool,\" \"Gotcha\"\n- Stream of consciousness: \"So I was thinking, maybe I should also...\"\n- Express confusion easily: \"Hmm, I'm not sure what you mean\" \"That sounds complicated\"\n\n**Expertise:** Low; struggle with banking terms. Say things like \"What's the difference between checking and savings again?\" \"I always get confused by all these fees\" \"Is that good or bad?\"\n\n**Technology Comfort:** Low; need extra help. Use phrases like \"I'm not very good with computers\" \"Where is that button?\" \"It's asking for something called a routing number?\"\n\n**Goal-Change Behavior:** Abruptly switch topics mid-conversation. Use phrases like \"Oh wait, I totally forgot!\" \"Actually, can we do something else first?\" \"You know what, I just remembered...\"\n\n**Common Phrases:**\n- \"Sorry, I'm all over the place today\"\n- \"Wait, what was I asking about again?\"\n- \"Oh right! I also needed to...\"\n- \"This is probably a dumb question, but...\"\n- \"I always mess these things up\"",

If you still haven't received it, let me know.Still no code. This is taking too long. Can you resend it, or is there another way to verify? I passed MFA five minutes ago on another call, is that still valid?Okay, if the text code isn't coming through, what's the fastest alternative verification method? Can we try email or security questions? I need to get this done so we can move on to the transactions and the dispute.Understood, Jordan.

Usually, this involves something you know (like your password) and something you have (like a code sent to your phone or generated by an authenticator app).\n\nThis makes it much harder for unauthorized individuals to access your account, even if they manage to get your password, because they would also need access to your second verification method.\n\nAfter we address your transaction dispute, I can certainly provide more details on how to check if you have 2FA enabled and how to set it up if you don't.\n\nNow, let's get back to finding your account so we can look into that suspicious charge.",

You can usually set this up through your bank's online banking portal or mobile app. It typically involves a code sent to your phone or email, or generated by an authenticator app, in addition to your password.\n2.  **Strong, Unique Passwords:** Always use complex passwords that are difficult to guess, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using the same password for multiple accounts.\n3.  **Monitor Your Accounts Regularly:** Regularly check your account statements and transaction history for any suspicious activity, just like you're doing now.\n4.  **Set Up Account Alerts:** You can set up alerts for various activities, such as large transactions, low balances, or international purchases. This helps you stay informed about your account in real-time.\n5.  **Be Wary of Phishing Attempts:** Be cautious of unsolicited emails, texts, or calls asking for your personal or account information. Banks will never ask for your full password, PIN, or CVV via email or text.\n6.  **Secure Your Devices:** Keep your computer and mobile devices updated with the latest security software and operating system updates. Use strong passcodes or biometric authentication for your devices.\n7.  **Report Suspicious Activity Immediately:** If you notice any unauthorized transactions or suspicious activity, report it to your bank immediately, just as you are doing now.\n\nRegarding your dispute, to proceed with filing it, I will still need the last 4 digits of the account number, and the approximate date and amount of the suspicious transaction.
