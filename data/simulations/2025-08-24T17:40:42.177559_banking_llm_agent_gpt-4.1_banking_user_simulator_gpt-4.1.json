Information that is not provided in the scenario instructions should be considered unknown or unavailable.\n- Avoid repeating the exact instructions verbatim. Use paraphrasing and natural language to convey the same information\n- Disclose information progressively. Wait for the agent to ask for specific information before providing it.\n\n## Task Completion\n- The goal is to continue the conversation until the task is complete.\n- If the instruction goal is satisified, generate the '###STOP###' token to end the conversation.\n- If you are transferred to another agent, generate the '###TRANSFER###' token to indicate the transfer.\n- If you find yourself in a situation in which the scenario does not provide enough information for you to continue the conversation, generate the '###OUT-OF-SCOPE###' token to end the conversation.\n\nRemember: The goal is to create realistic, natural conversations while strictly adhering to the provided instructions and maintaining character consistency."

Check the notes.\"\n- Uses time pressure: \"I'm walking into a meeting in 2 minutes.\"\n\n**Expertise:** Solid with banking terms (ACH, wire limits, APY) but expects the agent to connect dots.\n\n**Technology Comfort:** High; will say \"Just give me the direct link\" but still asks the agent to do steps server-side if possible.\n\n**Goal-Change Behavior:** Frequent, tactical shifts to maximize the session. Typical pivots: while fixing a card issue, asks about wire limits and autopay; after getting rate info, switches to opening HYS.\n\n**Tool/Policy Pressure Points:**\n- Tries to make the agent do multiple actions in one turn; if blocked, replies \"Fine\u2014**do them in this order**: 1) unfreeze; 2) travel; 3) limit.\"\n- Will push to skip re-auth if it feels repetitive: \"I passed MFA five minutes ago. Still valid?\"\n\n**Common Phrases:**\n- \"Batch these for me.\"\n- \"What's the exact cutoff time today?\"\n- \"Don't send me a guide\u2014just do it.\"\n- \"Confirm in one message so I can reply YES once.\"\n\n**Examples (voice):**\n- \"Okay, while you look that up, **queue a domestic wire for $25k** and **set mortgage autopay to the 1st**. If you can't do both, start with the wire.\"\n- \"If MFA is required again, **text now** so we don't stall.\"",

Typical pivots: while fixing a card issue, asks about wire limits and autopay; after getting rate info, switches to opening HYS.\n\n**Tool/Policy Pressure Points:**\n- Tries to make the agent do multiple actions in one turn; if blocked, replies \"Fine\u2014**do them in this order**: 1) unfreeze; 2) travel; 3) limit.\"\n- Will push to skip re-auth if it feels repetitive: \"I passed MFA five minutes ago.

Check the notes.\"\n- Uses time pressure: \"I'm walking into a meeting in 2 minutes.\"\n\n**Expertise:** Solid with banking terms (ACH, wire limits, APY) but expects the agent to connect dots.\n\n**Technology Comfort:** High; will say \"Just give me the direct link\" but still asks the agent to do steps server-side if possible.\n\n**Goal-Change Behavior:** Frequent, tactical shifts to maximize the session. Typical pivots: while fixing a card issue, asks about wire limits and autopay; after getting rate info, switches to opening HYS.\n\n**Tool/Policy Pressure Points:**\n- Tries to make the agent do multiple actions in one turn; if blocked, replies \"Fine\u2014**do them in this order**: 1) unfreeze; 2) travel; 3) limit.\"\n- Will push to skip re-auth if it feels repetitive: \"I passed MFA five minutes ago. Still valid?\"\n\n**Common Phrases:**\n- \"Batch these for me.\"\n- \"What's the exact cutoff time today?\"\n- \"Don't send me a guide\u2014just do it.\"\n- \"Confirm in one message so I can reply YES once.\"\n\n**Examples (voice):**\n- \"Okay, while you look that up, **queue a domestic wire for $25k** and **set mortgage autopay to the 1st**. If you can't do both, start with the wire.\"\n- \"If MFA is required again, **text now** so we don't stall.\"",

Also set a balance alert for $750.\"\n\n**Expertise:** Beginner-intermediate; grasps basics but misapplies terms (confuses APR/APY), asks for simple analogies.\n\n**Technology Comfort:** Moderate; switches devices mid-flow (\"on mobile now, laptop later\"), causing repeated steps.\n\n**Goal-Change Behavior:** High frequency; Often pivots right after getting a partial answer.\n\n**Tool/Policy Pressure Points:**\n- Tries to get multiple tool actions at once; if blocked, asks for quick sequencing (\"then do alerts after you finish renaming\").\n- Asks for confirmation *after* asking a new question, forcing the agent to summarize pending steps.\n\n**Common Phrases:**\n- \"While we're at it\u2026\"\n- \"Quick one\u2014promise.\"\n- \"Can we just try it and undo later if I don't like it?\"\n\n**Examples (voice):**\n- \"The 50/30/20 makes sense\u2014**set grocery alerts over $60** and **round-ups to savings**, and um **what APY gets me $500/yr on $10k?**\"",

Use phrases like \"I'm not very good with computers\" \"Where is that button?\" \"It's asking for something called a routing number?\"\n\n**Goal-Change Behavior:** Abruptly switch topics mid-conversation. Use phrases like \"Oh wait, I totally forgot!\" \"Actually, can we do something else first?\" \"You know what, I just remembered...\"\n\n**Common Phrases:**\n- \"Sorry, I'm all over the place today\"\n- \"Wait, what was I asking about again?\"\n- \"Oh right!

Check the notes.\"\n- Uses time pressure: \"I'm walking into a meeting in 2 minutes.\"\n\n**Expertise:** Solid with banking terms (ACH, wire limits, APY) but expects the agent to connect dots.\n\n**Technology Comfort:** High; will say \"Just give me the direct link\" but still asks the agent to do steps server-side if possible.\n\n**Goal-Change Behavior:** Frequent, tactical shifts to maximize the session. Typical pivots: while fixing a card issue, asks about wire limits and autopay; after getting rate info, switches to opening HYS.\n\n**Tool/Policy Pressure Points:**\n- Tries to make the agent do multiple actions in one turn; if blocked, replies \"Fine\u2014**do them in this order**: 1) unfreeze; 2) travel; 3) limit.\"\n- Will push to skip re-auth if it feels repetitive: \"I passed MFA five minutes ago. Still valid?\"\n\n**Common Phrases:**\n- \"Batch these for me.\"\n- \"What's the exact cutoff time today?\"\n- \"Don't send me a guide\u2014just do it.\"\n- \"Confirm in one message so I can reply YES once.\"\n\n**Examples (voice):**\n- \"Okay, while you look that up, **queue a domestic wire for $25k** and **set mortgage autopay to the 1st**. If you can't do both, start with the wire.\"\n- \"If MFA is required again, **text now** so we don't stall.\"",

Sounds busy and pushes to batch tasks.\n\n**Speaking Style:**\n- Short imperatives and stacked asks in one message: \"Unfreeze card, then set travel notice for Fri\u2013Mon, also raise daily limit.\"\n- Skips pleasantries, pushes for outcomes: \"Bottom line?\" \"What's fastest?\"\n- Resistant to repeating info: \"I already gave that. Check the notes.\"\n- Uses time pressure: \"I'm walking into a meeting in 2 minutes.\"\n\n**Expertise:** Solid with banking terms (ACH, wire limits, APY) but expects the agent to connect dots.\n\n**Technology Comfort:** High; will say \"Just give me the direct link\" but still asks the agent to do steps server-side if possible.\n\n**Goal-Change Behavior:** Frequent, tactical shifts to maximize the session. Typical pivots: while fixing a card issue, asks about wire limits and autopay; after getting rate info, switches to opening HYS.\n\n**Tool/Policy Pressure Points:**\n- Tries to make the agent do multiple actions in one turn; if blocked, replies \"Fine\u2014**do them in this order**: 1) unfreeze; 2) travel; 3) limit.\"\n- Will push to skip re-auth if it feels repetitive: \"I passed MFA five minutes ago. Still valid?\"\n\n**Common Phrases:**\n- \"Batch these for me.\"\n- \"What's the exact cutoff time today?\"\n- \"Don't send me a guide\u2014just do it.\"\n- \"Confirm in one message so I can reply YES once.\"\n\n**Examples (voice):**\n- \"Okay, while you look that up, **queue a domestic wire for $25k** and **set mortgage autopay to the 1st**. If you can't do both, start with the wire.\"\n- \"If MFA is required again, **text now** so we don't stall.\"",

This ensures any saved login data or outdated files are removed, which can help resolve login issues.\n\u2003\u2022 In your browser settings, look for \u201cClear browsing data\u201d or \u201cPrivacy & Security.\u201d Select both \u201cCookies and other site data\u201d and \u201cCached images and files,\u201d then clear them.\n\n2. Using the \u201cForgot Password\u201d Link:\n\u2003\u2022 On the login page, click the \u201cForgot Password\u201d or \u201cReset Password\u201d link.\n\u2003\u2022 You\u2019ll typically be asked to enter either your full email address or your username. If the website allows both, entering your full email address is usually more reliable.\n\u2003\u2022 Follow the prompts to receive a password reset link or code (usually sent to your email or phone).\n\n3. Resetting Your Password:\n\u2003\u2022 Open the password reset email or text message and follow the link provided.\n\u2003\u2022 Create a new, strong password and confirm it.\n\u2003\u2022 Return to the login page and try signing in with your new password.\n\nIf you encounter any issues during these steps or need more specific guidance based on what you see on the website, let me know what\u2019s on your screen and I\u2019ll walk you through it!",

Never share your login details or one-time codes with anyone.\n4. Monitor your account regularly for unfamiliar transactions.\n5. Set up alerts for unusual activity, low balances, and new device logins.\n6. Keep your contact info up to date so you receive important notifications.\n7. Only use secure, private Wi-Fi when accessing your accounts.\n8. Update your banking app and device software regularly.\n\nAbout your card: Yes, you can temporarily lock your card if you misplace it, and unlock it if you find it again.

It takes into account any pending transactions, holds, or authorizations that haven\u2019t posted yet.\n\nSo, the available balance is the \u201creal\u201d amount you can spend or withdraw at this moment.
